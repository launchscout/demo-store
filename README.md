# Launch Elements Demo Store

This is the demo store for [Launch Elements](https://elements.launchscout.com)

# Running with example data

To run the demo store with example data from a test store and test stripe account:

```
npm install
npm start
```

# Using your own Stripe Account

1. Sign up for an account at `elements.launchscout.com`
2. Connect your stripe account
3. Create a store
4. Copy the values from your store into .env
5. `npm start`

This will create product pages for each product it finds in your Stripe Account. If you don't have any products, you won't see anything :)
